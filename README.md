# Code of Conduct

_This is a living policy, subject to continual refinement and expansion. Last updated Dec 12, 2024._

Everyone participating in the TKTK community, including the TKTK Discord, TKTK Mattermost, and any events scheduled by and for the TKTK community, is required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. Anyone who violates our Code of Conduct may be removed from these spaces at the discretion of the TKTK staff.

If you have questions about this policy, or suggestions for ways it might be improved, please contact us at hi@tktk.community.

TKTK is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

## Definitions

Our definition of “harassment” includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “back rub”) without consent or after a request to stop
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect other TKTK community members or other vulnerable people from intentional abuse
* Publication of non-harassing private communication without consent by the involved parties

TKTK prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. TKTK staff reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:

* ‘Reverse’-isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
* Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
* Criticizing racist, sexist, transphobic, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, TKTK staff may take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all TKTK spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other TKTK community members or the general public.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you are being harassed by a member of the TKTK community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns related to this Code of Conduct, please contact us at hi@tktk.community.
